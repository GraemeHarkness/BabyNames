# BabyNames
I recently found that The National Records of Scotland publish statistical data about the
first names given to babies in Scotland:
http://nationalrecordsofscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/names/babies-first-names
Data exists for 1974-2104

I was interested to do some stats on which names have always been popular, which names have died out,
and which names have become popular.

Sounded like a good idea to play with Maven and Spark.
